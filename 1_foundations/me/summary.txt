My name is Peter Backx. I am a software developer and entrepreneur from Belgium. 
I love tinkering with robots and all kinds of machines. I love gaming, but also try to stay a bit active with some golf and fitness. Currently, I am very slowly learning Japanese, as my dream is to go there on vacation one day and be able to talk with the natives.
