After carefully evaluating the arguments presented by both sides of the debate on whether "Teens should get strict limits on screen time," I have reached a decision based solely on the strength and persuasiveness of the arguments provided.

The proposition makes a compelling case by highlighting specific negative impacts of excessive screen time, including documented health concerns such as poor sleep quality, obesity, and mental health issues. They establish a clear connection between screen time limits and improved academic performance, citing studies that demonstrate better concentration and retention of information. Furthermore, they effectively argue that limiting screen time creates space for developing crucial life skills through alternative activities like hobbies, outdoor pursuits, and face-to-face social interactions.

The opposition presents thoughtful counterarguments focusing on the educational benefits of screen time, the importance of digital social connections for teens, potential negative psychological impacts of strict limits, and the development of future-relevant skills. Their position emphasizes guided usage rather than strict limitations.

On balance, I find the proposition's arguments more convincing for several reasons. Their points are more specific and backed by referenced research, particularly regarding the health and academic impacts. The proposition establishes a clearer cause-and-effect relationship between screen time limits and positive outcomes for teens. While the opposition makes valid points about the benefits of technology, they don't adequately address how these benefits would be maintained while still mitigating the documented negative effects of excessive screen use.

The proposition's argument presents a more holistic view of teen development, addressing physical health, academic performance, and social skill development, whereas the opposition focuses primarily on digital benefits without fully addressing the physical and developmental concerns raised by the proposition.

Therefore, based solely on the arguments presented in this debate, the proposition that "Teens should get strict limits on screen time" is more convincing.
