The proposition that teens should have strict limits on screen time is essential in promoting their overall well-being and healthy development. Firstly, excessive screen time has been linked to various negative health outcomes, including poor sleep quality, obesity, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. By imposing strict limits, we can encourage healthier habits such as physical activity and face-to-face interactions that are crucial during this formative stage in life.

Additionally, setting boundaries on screen time can foster better academic performance. Many studies have demonstrated that reduced screen time can lead to improved concentration, retention of information, and, ultimately, better grades. The more time teens spend engaged with their screens, the less time they spend on valuable educational pursuits.

Moreover, strict limits on screen time can help in cultivating essential life skills. When teens are encouraged to explore hobbies, engage in outdoor activities, or spend quality time with family and friends, they develop better social skills, emotional intelligence, and creativity—all critical for their future success.

In conclusion, establishing strict limits on screen time for teens is not merely a matter of curbing their digital consumption; it is about safeguarding their physical health, enhancing academic performance, and nurturing essential life skills. By prioritizing these important aspects of development, we can prepare teens for a well-rounded and successful future.
