### Savory Quinoa-Stuffed Bell Pepper with a Twist

#### Ingredients:
- **For the Filling:**
  - 1 cup quinoa (rinsed)
  - 2 cups vegetable broth (homemade or low-sodium)
  - 1 medium onion (finely chopped)
  - 2 cloves garlic (minced)
  - 1 medium zucchini (diced)
  - 1 cup cherry tomatoes (halved)
  - 1 cup fresh spinach (roughly chopped)
  - 1 can (15 oz) black beans (drained and rinsed)
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp cumin
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - Fresh herbs (like cilantro or parsley) for garnish

- **For the Bell Peppers:**
  - 4 large bell peppers (any color)
  - Olive oil
  - Zest and juice of 1 lime

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Quinoa:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is fluffy and the broth is absorbed.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - In a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until translucent and fragrant.
   - Stir in the zucchini and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and spinach, cooking until the spinach wilts. 
   
3. **Combine the Filling:**
   - In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, sautéed vegetables, black beans, smoked paprika, cumin, lime zest, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Prepare the Bell Peppers:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). 
   - Slice the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. Drizzle the insides with olive oil and sprinkle with a touch of salt.
   - Fill each pepper generously with the quinoa mixture, pressing it down slightly to pack it in.

5. **Bake:**
   - Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. Add a splash of water to the bottom of the dish to create steam (this keeps the peppers moist).
   - Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the peppers are tender and slightly charred.

6. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with fresh herbs and a wedge of lime on the side. These stuffed peppers can be served warm or at room temperature, making them a versatile dish for any occasion!
